Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie.

It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169 to trastuzumab + vinorelbine. Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group.

In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients.

SOX10 Loss	668	Melanoma	1909		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB.

Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically. The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants.

Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data.

Multivariate logistic regression of KRAS mutations, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN protein expression also confirmed an independent effect of KRAS mutations on objective response (p = 0.0029).

PIK3CA Mutation	307	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Aspirin		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	"This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803) and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer."	23094721	PubMed		"Liao et al., 2012"		3	accepted	6375	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6375	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	FALSE

There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus.

Using cytogenetic and FISH analyses, a novel t(12;15)(p13;q25) rearrangement was identified in CFS cases (3 of 4, including 1 case likely presenting overgrowth of normal fibroblasts). Mapping of breakpoints and mRNA analysis revealed that the translocation gives rise to the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript, consisting of the HLH dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the kinase domain of NTRK3. This aberration was absent in adult-type fibrosarcoma (ATFS, 2 cases) and infantile fibromatosis (IFB, 15 cases).

Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15.

Previously, it was unclear whether this class of sarcomas should be classified as a separate entity or be classified as a variant of Ewing sarcoma. CIC-rearranged sarcomas showed a male predominance with an average age of 32 years old. A CIC::DUX4 fusion was found by additional FISH testing for DUX4 loci in 57% of the cases, with either a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 19 or between chromosomes 10 and 19. 57 patients were followed clinically and showed a 5-year survival rate of 43%, which was significantly lower than the 77% 5-year survival rate of Ewing sarcoma patients (p=0.002). In histologic evaluation, stromal myxoid change was a common finding in CIC-positive tumors, while this is not usually found in Ewing sarcoma. CIC-positive tumors showed a diffuse CD99 immunohistochemical staining pattern in only 23% of the cases, in contrast to that found in Ewing sarcoma, which showed a diffuse CD99 staining pattern in almost all of the cases.

There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76).

The study analyzed 101 patients who had undergone surgical resection of confirmed primary extra-abdominal or abdominal wall aggressive fibromatosis. Specimens were reviewed for the presence of T41A, S45F, and 45P mutations on the CTNNB1 gene. Mutations were found in 76 patients, with T41A being most common (n = 49), followed by S45F (n = 18), and 45P (n = 3). The 5-year cumulative risk of recurrence was 22.8%. Further analysis revealed that patients with an S45F mutation had a 5-year recurrence risk of 63.8% and an 8.5-fold higher risk of recurrence compared to patients with wild type tumors (P=0.006)."	25341748	PubMed		"van Broekhoven et al., 2015"		4	accepted	9788	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:44 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9788	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1260	FALSE

The 42 samples were then evaluated for PDGFB and PDGFRB gene amplification using qPCR. SYBR green assay was also used to evaluate PDGFB gene amplification in comparison with a reference gene and a normal tissue. PDGFB mRNA expression was detected in all analyzed samples and was significantly higher in tumor cells compared to adjacent normal tissue; as amplification levels (copy number of PDGFB/ copy number of reference gene) varied from 0.6. to 8.3 (mean 2.4) in 42 tumor samples, and from 0.4 to 3.0 (mean 1.2) in 20 adjacent normal tissue samples (P = 0.0002).

Upon addition of PDGF, further activation was also observed. Conversely, control cells showed activity only with the addition of both ligand and zinc. Gene expression profiling showed P21 gene was expressed at a higher level (1.7 folds) in mutant receptor cells, providing evidence of ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 activation. The mutant receptor produced a highly sustained ERK1/2 activation even after 1 hour of PDGF treatment, whereas wild-type expressing cells showed a decrease in ERK1/2 activity. Lastly, cells only expressing the variant K650E receptor were able to phosphorylate tyrosine in STAT1, and tyrosine, along with serine, in a ligand-independent manner in STAT3.

The study identified recurrent somatic alterations in 154 tumors (90%), encompassing all 140 tumors subjected to WGS. Among the seven angiocentric gliomas (AGs) examined, six displayed intrachromosomal deletions leading to MYB::QKI rearrangements, and the remaining one contained a MYB::ESR1 rearrangement. To validate these findings, 12 additional AGs with only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (n=9) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) and/or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) (n=3). All tested cases were confirmed to harbor MYB rearrangement or deletion, though the specific gene partners were not determined. Functional studies both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that MYB::QKI rearrangements facilitate tumorigenesis through activating MYB through truncation of a 3' region, driving aberrant MYB::QKI expression through enhancer translocation, and losing a single copy of the QKI tumor suppressor gene. The research concluded that MYB::QKI represents a novel recurrent fusion defining AGs diagnostically."	26829751	PubMed		"Bandopadhayay et al., 2016"		4	accepted	11065	Somatic	2024-03-25 16:05:40 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11065	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4217	FALSE

All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. The predicted fusion protein contains the TEAD binding site of YAP1 (located in exon 1), which is essential for tethering the protein to genes to activate transcription, and swaps the YAP1 transactivating domain for the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of TFE3. Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ.

YAP1::TFE3 Fusion	4622	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	80190	"Late onset,Intermediate young adult onset,Late young adult onset,Middle age onset"			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	"This 2021 paper by Dermawan, et al. was a multi-institutional clinicopathological study of 24 cases of YAP1::TFE3 fusion-positive epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), with an age range of 20 to 78 years old. All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. While conventional WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE is characterized by relatively uniform morphology, YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma exhibits remarkable inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity with distinctive morphologic features not seen in conventional EHE. A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis. The authors propose categorizing YAP1::TFE3 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a distinct disease entity from conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (which typically harbors WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusions) due to its clinical and histopathologic characteristics."	34381186	PubMed		"Dermawan et al., 2021"		4	accepted	11682	Somatic	2024-01-16 20:51:56 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11682	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4622	FALSE

The total of 20 patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancer were treated on these trials (tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 19 and neuroendocrine carcinoma in one patient), of which 15 were evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) among those 15 patients was 73%: one patient had a complete response, 10 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease as best response. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 33.9 months, 35.4 months, and 40.7 months, respectively. Of the total of 20 NTRK-fusions positive lung cancer cases, 6 had TPM3::NTRK1 fusion, but detailed response information was only provided for one TPM3::NTRK1 positive case. This patient was a 46-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer which previously progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy after 9 months and on the PD-1 inhibitor dostarlimab after 2 months. A TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was identified on molecular profiling, and larotrectinib was initiated on a trial. A brisk and sustained partial response was achieved. The patient discontinued treatment because of progressive disease after a durable 39 months of disease control.

The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3.

The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas.

Using RT-PCR they confirmed the presence of the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in another 4 cases of t(1;3)(p36;q25) positive EHE. The fusion involved either exon 2 (type 1 fusion transcript) or exon 3 (type 2 fusion transcript) of WWTR1 in-frame to exon 9 of CAMTA1. To determine the incidence of WWTR1::CAMTA1 they performed FISH with break-apart probes that flanked the WWTR1 or CAMTA1 gene regions on 47 EHE samples. The analysis detected CAMTA1 rearrangement in 39 of 45 EHE tumors (87%) and 42 of 47 (89%) harbored a rearrangement of the WWTR1 gene region, while all other vascular tumors were negative.

The t(4;9)(q13;q31) did not result in coding fusion transcripts but rather caused upregulation of NR4A3 through enhancer hijacking. Twenty-eight of 29 acinic cell carcinomas (97%) showed nuclear immunostaining for NR4A3, while normal salivary gland tissue was negative.

The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case. On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. The authors conclude identification of different fusions by gene-specific FISH probes can confirm differences underlying the histologically different pure SEF (mostly EWSR1 rearranged) from LGFMS variants (mainly FUS rearranged)."	25231134	PubMed		"Prieto-Granada et al., 2015"		3	accepted	12059	Somatic	2024-06-23 00:01:05 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12059	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5154	TRUE

The samples were collected from pediatric oncology centers across the United States, ensuring a diverse representation of clinical cases. The study found that TCF3 breakpoints were clustered in two specific intronic regions of the TCF3 gene. Type 1 translocations were identified in two patients, involving intron 16, which connected TCF3 exon 16 to HLF exon 4. These translocations included inserted non-template and intronic sequences, as well as new splice acceptor sites. Conversely, Type 2 translocations, observed in three patients, involved intron 15, linking TCF3 exon 15 to HLF exon 4. Monoallelic PAX5 deletions were enriched in TCF3::HLF positive ALL, detected in 3/5 cases compared to being generally observed in 13% of ALL cases, and PAX5 expression was reduced in all TCF3::HLF positive cases. The authors concluded that the TCF3::HLF fusion likely occurs in B lymphoid progenitors within the context of PAX5 haploinsufficiency.

Patients were aged 0-29 years old. CEBPA mutations were identified in 160/2958 cases (5.4%). 132 (82.5%) cases had two CEBPA mutations, one in the transactivation domain (TAD) and the other in the basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain (CEBPA-double-mutated [CEBPA-dm]). 28 cases (17.5%) had a single CEBPA mutation in the bZip region (CEBPA-bZip). CEBPA bZIP and CEBPA-dm AML cases were typically characterized by higher white blood cell counts and normal karyotypes, had a characteristic pattern of secondary mutations frequently involving CSF3R and GATA2, had a unique expression profile, and were associated with a favorable outcome. It was confirmed that both CEBPA-bZip and CEBPA-dm cases have shared clinical and molecular features and were both associated with a favorable prognosis, which had not been established for pediatric AML before this study. The key finding is thus that CEBPA-bZip mutation is sufficient to drive this leukemia and should be considered as the defining molecular lesion for CEBPA mutant AML. Isolated CEBPA-TAD mutations were rare.

The study reveals that when CEBPA mutations occur before CSF3R mutations, they drive leukemogenesis by blocking myeloid differentiation, resulting in AML. Enhancer and transcription factor motif analysis demonstrated that wild-type CEBPA activates differentiation-related enhancers, while mutant CEBPA disrupts this pathway. Additionally, RNA-seq data show that CSF3R mutations alone promote differentiation, whereas early CEBPA mutations lead to a stem/progenitor-like phenotype with heightened cell cycle activity. In mouse models, cells with early CEBPA mutations progress to aggressive, immature leukemia, contrasting with the slower, partially differentiated progression seen with initial CSF3R mutations.

As these are genetic alterations activating kinase or cytokine receptor signalling, these lesions could be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This paper documented the following JAK2 fusions: BCR::JAK2, STRN3::JAK2 and PAX5::JAK2. All JAK2 fusions identified in the study are in-frame and disrupt the pseudokinase domain of JAK2, which is thought to relieve autoinhibition of the kinase domain, resulting in a constitutively active fusion protein. The authors performed targeted analysis for these specific detected fusions in another 231 cases of high risk B-progenitor ALL from the COG AALL0232. They did not identify any othe cases with the same JAK2 fusions, however this does not rule out JAK2 fusions with other not targeted partners. JAK2 rearrangements were not identified in the MPN, CMML, and AML cohorts, and have not been detected in other childhood B-ALL subtypes studied by WGS and mRNA-seq, indicating they are highly enriched in Ph-like ALL. Flow cytometric phosphosignaling analysis on the cases with BCR::JAK2 and STRN3::JAK2 fusions demonstrated activation of downstream signaling pathways and tyrosine phosphorylation. This basal level of phosphorylation was then reduced with the JAK2 inhibitor XL019. Dasatinib was able to slightly inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation in the JAK2 cases. A BCR::JAK2 rearranged xenograft model was also tested to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. There was a striking decrease in leukemic burden after 4 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment compared to vehicle-treated controls confirming the role of the BCR::JAK2 fusion as the key abnormality driving survival and proliferation of leukemia cells."	22897847	PubMed		"Roberts et al., 2012"		4	accepted	12256	Somatic	2025-01-09 00:57:11 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12256	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2445	FALSE

AMKL is a rare and heterogeneous aggresive disease that progresses rapidly, having a median patient survival of only eight months.The analysis focused on five patients, all infants and young children, diagnosed with AMKL carrying the t(1;22) translocation. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based positional cloning, the study defined the genomic breakpoints associated with the t(1;22) translocation. The researchers mapped breakpoints to a 28-kb intron on chromosome 22q13 and a 6-kb interval on chromosome 1p13. Subsequent analyses revealed a novel fusion gene, RBM15::MRTFA, resulting from the translocation. The RBM15::MRTFA fusion transcript encodes a chimeric protein that incorporates functional motifs from both genes, including RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) from RBM15 and the SAP domain from MRTFA, potentially driving leukemogenesis through deregulation of RNA processing and altered transcriptional activity. This study highlights the central pathogenic role of the RBM15::MRTFA fusion in AMKL and its diagnostic significance, drawing parallels with other fusion-driven leukemias such as PML::RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

B-ALL is a heterogeneous disease, and identifying cytogenetic abnormalities allows accurate stratification into genetically defined subtypes. The analysis included 342 children diagnosed with B-ALL, among whom 99 cases (28.9%) were positive for the ETV6::RUNX1 fusion, detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular screening. The translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) results in the fusion of ETV6 (TEL) on chromosome 12 and RUNX1 (AML1) on chromosome 21, creating a chimeric protein that disrupts normal hematopoietic differentiation and contributes to leukemogenesis. The study findings indicate that patients with the ETV6::RUNX1 fusion have a better event-free survival (EFS) compared to those without the fusion. While only 3% of ETV6::RUNX1-positive patients relapsed, the relapse rate in ETV6::RUNX1-negative cases was significantly higher (11.1%). This study underscores the diagnostic significance of the ETV6::RUNX1 fusion, highlighting its role as a key molecular marker in pediatric B-ALL."	9226156	PubMed		"Borkhardt et al., 1997"		4	accepted	12293	Somatic	2025-02-26 23:42:51 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12293	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3009	FALSE

The authors utilized RT-PCR to detect the TLS/FUS::ERG chimeric transcripts in 19 AML cases with the t(16;21)(p11;q22) identified through karyotype analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 22 years (range 2 to 61 years ). The fusion transcript was consistently detected, even during remission, suggesting its role in identifying persistent leukemic cells and potential chemoresistance. The reliable detection of the TLS/FUS::ERG chimeric transcripts at diagnosis demonstrates their utility as a highly sensitive molecular marker for initial AML diagnosis and ongoing disease monitoring. The study also identified a novel transcript variant (Type D), characterized by an additional 138 nucleotides from TLS/FUS exon 8 and ERG exons 7 and 8, which highlights increased molecular heterogeneity in this genetic alteration.

Molecular profiling used Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays, SMARCB1 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and sequencing. Additionally, the survival outcome of the CRINET cohort was compared to a larger cohort of 27 patients with ATRT-TYR.

CRINET cases showed diverse SMARCB1 alterations in copy number and mutations. 9 of 10 cases of CRINET harboured large heterozygous chr22q deletions inclusive of the SMARCB1 gene, with SMARCB1 mutations in the other allele in 5 cases (2 of which were germline). Methylation profiling placed CRINET within the AT/RT-tyrosinase (TYR) subgroup. Histologically, CRINET exhibited distinct morphology from AT/RT-TYR, although all CRINET cases and 9/10 AT/RT-TYR cases showed immunohistochemical staining for tyrosinase. Clinically, CRINET patients (n=10) showed better survival than ATRT-TYR patients (n=27). Mean overall survival was 125 months (95% CI: 100–151) for CRINET and 53 months (95% CI: 33–74) for ATRT-TYR.

Using molecular and cytogenetic analyses, they examined eight APL patients and the NB4 cell line, derived from an APL patient. The study identified a RARα fusion transcript, formed by the translocation of RARα from chromosome 17 to the partner gene on chromosome 15. Southern blot analysis detected RARα gene rearrangements in six of the eight APL patients, while these alterations were absent in normal and non-APL leukemic controls. These findings strongly implicate RARα in APL leukemogenesis and suggest that the t(15;17) translocation results in a fusion gene that disrupts normal RARα function, contributing to the disease.

NUP98::v Fusion	5423	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With NUP98 Rearrangement		"Middle age onset,Young adult onset,Pediatric onset"			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	"In this 2014 study the authors investigated the presence of NUP98::NSD1 fusion in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Utilizing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the NUP98::NSD1 fusion was identified in 39/920 (4%) patients. Since 36 of the 39 NUP98::NSD1 patients were either FLT3 ITD positive or cytogenetically normal (CN-AML) a further 620 patients who harbored FLT3 ITD and/or CN-AML were included for screening, with the NUP98::NSD1 identified in 63 (10%) patients. All patients harbored the identical in-frame fusion of NUP98 exon 12 and NSD1 exon 6. Age of patients with NUP98::NSD1 varied from <1 to 50 years of age (median, 10 years), indicating that NUP98::NSD1 is more frequent in younger age. NUP98::NSD1 cases frequently (82%) harbored a FLT3 ITD, and 26% harbored simultaneously FLT3 ITD and WT1 mutations. The authors conclude that the NUP98::NSD1 fusion, frequently co-occurring with FLT3 ITD, defines a subgroup of AML patients at very high risk for induction failure; the study supports upfront screening of CN-AML for the cytogenetically cryptic NUP98::NSD1 fusion."	25145343	PubMed		"Ostronoff et al., 2014"		4	accepted	12379	Somatic	2025-04-16 23:17:41 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12379	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5423	TRUE
NUP98::v Fusion	5423	Acute Myeloid Leukemia With NUP98 Rearrangement		"Early young adult onset,Pediatric onset"			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	"In this 2023 study the authors included 2,235 children and young adults diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NUP98 fusions were detected in these patients either by karyotype of RNA sequencing. Overall 160 patients (7.2%) were identified to have a NUP98 rearrangement. The most common NUP98 translocations were NUP98::NSD1 (108/160) and NUP98::KDM5A (32/160), however 20 patients were detected with 13 different NUP98 translocation partners, including HOXA9 (n=4), HOXD13 (n=3), PHF15 (n=2), PHF23 (n=2) and single cases of BPTF, BRWD3, DDX10, HMGB3, HOXA13, KAT7, PRRX1, SET, and TOP1. NUP98 fusions were enriched in children aged 3-10 years old. NUP98 fusion breakpoints by RNA sequencing revealed a high diversity of NUP98 exon junctions, although 85% of NUP98 fusions had a breakpoint junction in exon 12 or 13, the remaining cases had breakpoints occurring in various positions from exon 11 to exon 29. The NUP98::KDM5A immunophenotype corresponded to megakaryocytic maturation. For NUP98:NSD1 cases, enrichment of FLT3 ITD (74%) and WT1 mutations (42%) was detected. The authors conclude that NUP98 fusions constitute a highly refractory class of AML, regardless of fusion partner."	36815378	PubMed		"Bertrums et al., 2023"	"NCT00372593,NCT01371981,NCT00002798,NCT00070174"	4	accepted	12380	Somatic	2025-04-16 23:17:28 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12380	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5423	TRUE
IGH::MYC Fusion	5427	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With MYC Rearrangement		"Late onset,Childhood onset,Intermediate young adult onset,Middle age onset,Juvenile onset"			Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	"In this 2018 study, the authors analyzed tumor samples from 13 patients diagnosed with IG-MYC–positive neoplasms exhibiting a precursor B-cell phenotype. This entity is molecularly distinct from classical Burkitt lymphoma (BL), which arises from mature germinal center B cells, whereas these cases originate from the same immature B-cell precursors like precursor B-cell leukemias/lymphomas (pB-ALL/LBL currently known as B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LL)]. The cohort included 11 leukemic presentations and 2 nodal cases, with six patients displaying L3/Burkitt-like morphology. The median age at diagnosis was 21 years (range 3–75), with a predominance in males (11 out of 13 patients). Relapse samples from three patients were also included. IG-MYC translocations involved IGH in 10 cases, IGK in 1, and IGL in 2. Notably, four cases (including the cell line 380) harbored a concurrent t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 translocation, with a median age of 18 years (range 13–43), making transformation from an undetected follicular lymphoma unlikely. Supporting this, cell line 380 lacked mutations typically observed in follicular lymphoma. The IG-MYC rearrangements in pB-ALL/LBL were found to result from aberrant V(D)J recombination, a mechanism characteristic of early B-cell development. Most cases lacked functional B-cell receptor (BCR) expression due to biallelic IGH alterations and harbored NRAS or KRAS mutations, while mutations commonly found in BL were absent. DNA methylation profiling demonstrated that the cases clustered with precursor B cells and pB-ALL/LBL rather than with BL. These findings support the conclusion that recurrent IG-MYC translocations define a subset of pB-ALL/LBL characterized by distinct molecular features."	30282799	PubMed		"Wagener et al., 2018"		3	accepted	12381	Somatic	2025-04-30 22:41:09 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12381	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5427	TRUE
IGH::MYC Fusion	5427	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With MYC Rearrangement		"Late onset,Middle age onset"			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	"In this 2018 study, the authors described three rare adult cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL) exhibiting Burkitt lymphoma-like morphology driven by isolated IGH/MYC translocations—a genetic abnormality typically associated with mature B-cell neoplasms. All three cases occurred in male patients presenting initially with diffuse lymphadenopathy. Cases 1 and 2 were diagnosed as B-ALL with markedly elevated lymphoblast counts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, while Case 3, a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, was diagnosed with B-LBL based on a retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy, without bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement. Despite the Burkitt-like morphology, all cases retained an immature B-cell immunophenotype, justifying their classification as MYC-positive B-ALL/LBL. These cases are exceptionally rare, particularly in the absence of concurrent BCL2 rearrangements. The study utilized clinical assessments, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and cytogenetic analyses to characterize the immunophenotype and detect MYC rearrangements. All three patients presented with aggressive clinical features, demonstrated variable responses to therapy, and ultimately had poor prognoses. The findings highlight that MYC rearrangements characterize a subtype of B-ALL/LBL with unique clinical and molecular features and unfavorable outcome."	29112016	PubMed		"Li et al., 2018"		3	accepted	12382	Somatic	2025-04-30 22:41:39 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12382	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5427	TRUE
IGH::MYC Fusion	5427	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia With MYC Rearrangement		Infantile onset			Diagnostic	Supports	C	Positive	"In this 2022 study, the authors reported a rare case of atypical Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma (BL) in a 10-month-old infant, exhibiting overlapping features of both classical BL and its precursor form, preBLL. PreBLL is generally characterized by an immature B-cell immunophenotype, IGH::MYC translocations arising from aberrant V(D)J recombination, and frequent NRAS/KRAS mutations. In contrast, classical BL is associated with mature B-cell markers and recurrent mutations in MYC, ID3, and CCND3. The patient in this case demonstrated immunophenotypic immaturity, including the absence of CD20 and surface immunoglobulins, alongside BL-like morphology and an IGH::MYC rearrangement generated through V(D)J recombination. Whole-exome sequencing identified somatic mutations in FBXO11, commonly seen in classical BL, as well as TNIK and a mosaic KRAS mutation, the latter being more typical of preBLL and developmental disorders. These findings indicate a maturation stage intermediate between classical BL and preBLL. Despite the atypical molecular and phenotypic presentation, the patient achieved sustained remission following high-risk chemotherapy and remained disease-free after 38 months. This case illustrates association of IGH::MYC rearrangement with a unique type of preBLL distinct from BL."	34472720	PubMed		"Yoshida et al., 2022"		3	accepted	12383	Somatic	2025-04-30 22:43:19 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12383	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5427	TRUE
