Of course. Here is a technical specification document for the DGG Variant Interpretation Engine (PCGR), tailored for an LLM agentic system.

## **Technical Specification: DGG Variant Interpretation Engine (PCGR)**

### **1.0 Background and Goals**

#### **1.1 Context**

In the field of **precision oncology**, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumors generates vast amounts of genomic data. A significant challenge lies in translating this raw data into clinically meaningful and actionable insights. Manually interpreting genomic variants is time-consuming, requires specialized expertise, and is difficult to standardize.

#### **1.2 Primary Goals**

PCGR is a bioinformatics software pipeline designed to automate and standardize the interpretation of cancer genomes. Its primary goals are:

  * **Automate Interpretation:** To systematically process somatic genomic alterations (SNVs, InDels, CNAs) from a tumor sample.
  * **Provide Clinical Context:** To annotate variants with evidence from curated knowledgebases regarding their oncogenicity and clinical actionability (therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic).
  * **Generate Actionable Reports:** To produce a comprehensive, tiered, and interactive HTML report suitable for review by clinical researchers and oncologists.
  * **Integrate Multi-Omics Data:** To incorporate transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data for a more holistic view of tumor biology, including gene expression and immune contexture.

### **2.0 System Architecture**

#### **2.1 High-Level Overview**

PCGR is a command-line-driven pipeline orchestrated by a main Python script. It processes input files through a sequence of specialized bioinformatics tools and custom scripts to produce a final report. The entire software stack is encapsulated within a **Docker container** to ensure reproducibility and simplify dependency management.

#### **2.2 Technology Stack**

  * **Orchestration:** Python
  * **Data Analysis & Visualization:** R
  * **Core Annotation:** Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
  * **Custom Annotation:** `vcfanno`
  * **Deployment:** Docker

#### **2.3 Key Modules**

1.  **Input Validation & Configuration:** Parses a YAML configuration file and validates all input data paths and formats.
2.  **Genomic Annotation:** The core annotation engine that uses VEP and `vcfanno` to layer multiple tiers of information onto the input VCF file.
3.  **Genomic Analyses:** A suite of R scripts that perform key analyses:
      * Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) calculation.
      * Microsatellite Instability (MSI) prediction.
      * Mutational Signature deconstruction.
4.  **Report Generation:** An R Markdown (`.Rmd`) script that synthesizes all generated data into the final, interactive HTML output.

### **3.0 Data Model: Inputs & Outputs**

#### **3.1 Required Inputs**

The system requires specific file formats for its inputs.

  * **Somatic Variants (VCF):**
      * **Format:** A standard Variant Call Format (`.vcf` or `.vcf.gz`) file containing somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and/or small insertions/deletions (InDels).
      * **Source:** The VCF must be pre-annotated by the Ensembl **Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)**.
  * **Configuration File (YAML):**
      * **Format:** A `.yml` file specifying all parameters for the run.
      * **Content:** Includes tumor type, sequencing assay type (e.g., `WES`, `WGS`, `TARGETED`), genome assembly (`grch37` or `grch38`), and paths to all input files.

#### **3.2 Optional Inputs**

  * **Copy Number Aberrations (CNA):**
      * **Format:** A tab-separated (`.tsv`) file listing gene-level copy number calls (e.g., "amplification", "homozygous\_deletion").
  * **RNA-seq Expression Data:**
      * **Format:** A tab-separated (`.tsv`) file containing gene expression data, typically with gene identifiers (e.g., Ensembl IDs) and expression values (e.g., TPM/FPKM).

#### **3.3 Primary Outputs**

  * **Interactive HTML Report:**
      * **Format:** A single, self-contained `.html` file. This is the primary output for human interpretation.
      * **Content:** Contains all summary statistics, interactive plots (mutational signatures, TMB), and tiered variant tables. Variants are hyperlinked to external knowledgebases (e.g., dbSNP, COSMIC, ClinVar).
  * **Annotated Data Files (TSV):**
      * **Format:** Multiple tab-separated (`.tsv`) files containing the full, annotated data for variants, CNAs, and expression outliers. These are suitable for downstream computational analysis.

### **4.0 Core Logic & Algorithms**

#### **4.1 Variant Tiering System**

The central logic of PCGR is its 5-tier classification system, which categorizes variants to highlight clinical relevance.

  * **Tier 1: Strong Clinical Significance:** Variants with established therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic value as defined by **AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines**.
  * **Tier 2: Potential Clinical Significance:** Variants in known cancer genes that are predicted to be pathogenic/oncogenic but lack the strong evidence of Tier 1. Based on **ClinGen/CGC/VICC guidelines**.
  * **Tier 3: Uncertain Clinical Significance:** Variants in cancer genes with unclear functional consequences or variants in genes not strongly associated with the specific tumor type.
  * **Tier 4: Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS):** Variants in established cancer genes that are not classified in Tiers 1-3.
  * **Tier 5: Benign/Likely Benign:** Variants considered to be non-pathogenic.

#### **4.2 Biomarker Algorithms**

  * **TMB Calculation:** Calculated as the number of non-synonymous somatic mutations per megabase (Mb) of the coding region covered by the sequencing assay. The exome size is configurable.
  * **Mutational Signature Analysis:** Uses a deconstruction approach to determine the contribution of known COSMIC mutational signatures to the tumor's mutation profile.
  * **MSI Status Prediction:** Employs a machine learning model (based on somatic mutation patterns) to predict microsatellite instability status, particularly for colorectal and endometrial cancers.

### **5.0 Execution & Invocation**

The software is executed via a command-line interface (CLI) call to its Docker container. The user must mount local directories for input data and output results into the container's file system.

#### **5.1 Example CLI Command:**

```bash
# Define local directories
export PCGR_DIR=/path/to/pcgr_data
export INPUT_DIR=/path/to/my/tumor_data
export OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/my/output

# Run the PCGR Docker container
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ${PCGR_DIR}:/pcgr_data \
  -v ${INPUT_DIR}:/workdir/input \
  -v ${OUTPUT_DIR}:/workdir/output \
  sigven/pcgr:latest \
  pcgr.py \
  --input_vcf /workdir/input/somatic.vep.vcf.gz \
  --cna_tsv /workdir/input/somatic.cna.tsv \
  --pcgr_dir /pcgr_data \
  --output_dir /workdir/output \
  --genome_assembly grch38 \
  --config_yaml /workdir/input/my_pcgr_config.yaml
```
