Excellent question. The approach to a complex task like merging two codebases has shifted dramatically with modern AI. Today, it's not about a single, magical "merge" button, but about a **developer-led process using a suite of integrated AI tools.**

The human developer acts as the **architect and project manager**, while the AI acts as an incredibly fast and knowledgeable **pair programmer or executor**.

Here is the general tooling people would use today to accomplish this task.

### 1. The Development Environment: An AI-Aware IDE

The foundation of the entire process is a code editor that can understand multiple project folders at once and is deeply integrated with AI.

* **Tool:** **Visual Studio (VS) Code**
* **Key Feature:** **Multi-Root Workspaces.** This is the critical starting point. You would open the parent folder containing `dgg_rules_somatic`, `dgg_rules_germline`, and your new `unified-cancer-reporter` directories all in one VS Code window. This gives both you and the AI tools a complete view of all the source code and its history.

### 2. The Primary AI Assistant: Your Pair Programmer

This is the tool you interact with most directly, giving it specific, file-by-file or feature-by-feature instructions.

* **Tool:** **GitHub Copilot** (specifically Copilot Chat)
* **Workflow:** Inside your multi-root workspace, you would direct Copilot to perform the merge, piece by piece. You would have a chat window open and give it instructions like:
    * **Dependency Merging:** "Analyze `dgg_rules_somatic/environment.yml` and `dgg_rules_germline/pyproject.toml`. Create a single, unified `pyproject.toml` in the `unified-cancer-reporter` directory that combines all dependencies and resolves any version conflicts by choosing the latest version."
    * **Code Refactoring:** "Take the VCF parsing class from `dgg_rules_somatic/src/dgg_engine/vcf.py`. Copy it into `unified-cancer-reporter/src/core/parser.py` and refactor it to have no dependencies on the rest of the original codebase."
    * **API Integration:** "Now, find all places in the `dgg_rules_germline` codebase that read VCF files and update them to use the new `core.parser` module in our unified repository."

### 3. The AI-First Editor (A More Integrated Alternative)

For developers who want an even deeper integration, they might use an editor built specifically around this workflow.

* **Tool:** **Cursor**
* **Workflow:** Cursor is a fork of VS Code that is designed from the ground up for AI-driven, multi-file changes. It builds a more comprehensive "map" of your entire codebase. You can select multiple files or folders across your workspace and give it a high-level instruction like, "Refactor all VCF processing logic from the `somatic` and `germline` projects into a single, shared library in the `unified` project," and it will attempt to plan and execute the changes across all relevant files.

### 4. Emerging Autonomous Agents (The "Specialist Intern")

These tools are at the cutting edge and can handle more complex, multi-step tasks with a single, higher-level prompt. They are less of a "pair programmer" and more of an "agent" you delegate a full work ticket to.

* **Tool:** **Devin AI** (from Cognition Labs)
* **Workflow:** You would provide the agent with access to the workspace and a detailed task description, much like the feature plan we developed. For example:
    > "Your task is to implement the unified germline pipeline. Following the plan in `unified-cancer-reporter/docs/plan.md`, take the relevant variant classification logic from the `dgg_rules_germline` directory, refactor it into the new modular structure in `unified-cancer-reporter/src/germline/`, update its dependencies to use the shared `core` library, and write basic unit tests for the classification functions. Create a pull request when complete."

Even with these advanced agents, the human still provides the architectural plan and reviews the final pull request.

### Summary of the Modern Toolchain

| Tool | Role in the Workflow | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VS Code** | **The Workspace:** The foundational environment that holds all codebases. | Essential for any complex project. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | **The Pair Programmer:** Executes specific, well-defined refactoring tasks given by you. | The standard, most accessible tool for day-to-day AI assistance. |
| **Cursor** | **The AI-First Editor:** A more powerful alternative for complex, cross-file refactoring. | Developers who want the deepest possible AI integration in their editor. |
| **Devin AI** | **The Autonomous Agent:** Handles a complete, multi-step work ticket based on a high-level plan. | Delegating large, well-defined features (still emerging technology). |
