# Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR) <a href="https://sigven.github.io/pcgr/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="90" width="76"/></a>


The Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR) is a stand-alone software package for functional annotation and translation of individual tumor genomes for precision cancer medicine. It interprets primarily somatic SNVs/InDels and copy number aberrations, and has additional support for interpretation of bulk RNA-seq expression data. The software classifies variants with respect to predicted _oncogenicity_, and clinical _actionability_. Interactive HTML output reports allow the user to interrogate the clinical impact of the molecular findings in an individual tumor.

- Variant classification
  - according to *oncogenicity*: evaluating the oncogenic potential of somatic DNA aberrations ([ClinGen/CGC/VICC guidelines](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35101336/))
  - according to *actionability*: mapping the therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic implications of somatic DNA aberrations ([AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993330/))
- Tumor mutational burden (TMB) estimation
- Mutational signature analysis
- Microsatellite instability (MSI) classification
- RNA-seq support - gene expression outlier detection, sample similarity analysis, and immune contexture profiling

PCGR supports both of the most recent human genome assemblies (GRCh37/GRCh38), and accepts variant calls from both tumor-control and tumor-only sequencing assays. Much of the functionality is intended for whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing assays, but you can also apply PCGR to output from targeted sequencing panels. If you are interested in the interrogation of germline variants and their relation to cancer predisposition, we recommend trying the accompanying tool [Cancer Predisposition Sequencing Reporter (CPSR)](https://github.com/sigven/cpsr).

## Why use PCGR?

The great complexity of acquired mutations in individual tumor genomes poses a severe challenge for clinical interpretation. PCGR aims to be a comprehensive reporting platform that can

- systematically interrogate tumor-specific variants in the context of known therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic biomarkers
- highlight genomic aberrations with likely oncogenic potential
- provide a structured and concise summary of the most relevant findings
- present the results in a format accessible to clinical experts

PCGR integrates a [comprehensive set of knowledge resources](articles/annotation_resources.html) related to tumor biology and therapeutic biomarkers, both at the gene, and at the level of individual variants. The software generates a comprehensive molecular interpretation report that supports the translation of individual cancer genomes towards molecularly guided treatment strategies.
