<p>PCGR integrates a variety of different datasets relating to precision
cancer medicine, that often use different ontologies when it comes to
diseases or phenotypes. We have cross-referenced a variety of ontologies
(DiseaseOntology, EFO, OncoTree, UMLS, ICD-10) that are in use in the
oncology domain, and organized all the various tumor subtypes into 30
different main tumor sites (see also <a href="https://github.com/sigven/phenOncoX" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/sigven/phenOncoX</a>).</p>
<p>Below you can browse all the various phenotype terms (including
specific tumor subtypes) that are associated with each of the primary
sites. This as a guide to choose the primary tumor type when running
PCGR for a given sample (option <code>--tumor_site</code>).</p>
