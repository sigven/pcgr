## Output files

PCGR generates multiple output files with annotations of molecular aberrations, including an interactive report, an Excel workbook, and pure text-based annotation files (TSV).

### HTML report - quarto-based

An interactive and structured HTML report that shows the most relevant 
findings in the query cancer genome has the following naming convention:

- `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.html`
  - The __sample_id__ is provided as input by the user, and reflects a unique 
  identifier of the tumor-normal sample pair to be analyzed.

The report is structured in various sections, pending upon the input provided
by the user. The following sections may be included in the report:

1. __Settings__
	* Lists key configurations for the analysis, including the genome assembly, type of sequencing assay (WES/WGS/TARGETED), the cancer type (as provided by the user), and the tumor purity and ploidy.
	 
2. __Somatic SNVs/InDels__
	* Provides an overview of the somatic SNVs and InDels detected in the tumor sample
	* Includes a global distribution of allelic support, statistics with respect to
	   variant types and consequences
	* Variants are classified with respect to predicted _oncogenicity_ (ClinGen/CGC/VICC standard operating procedures)
	   - permits also exploration of somatic mutations through interactive filtering according to several dimensions (variant sequencing depth/support, variant consequence etc.)
	* Variants are classified with respect to clinical _actionability_ (AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines)
	   - individual evidence items linked to actionable variants can be explored, indicating strength of evidence, tumor type and therapeutic context, and clinical significance

3. __Somatic CNAs__
	* Aberrations are classified with respect to clinical _actionability_ (AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines)
	 - individual evidence items linked to actionable variants can be explored, indicating strength of evidence, tumor type and therapeutic context, and clinical significance
	* Other potentially oncogenic aberrations are listed, pProto-oncogenes subject to copy number amplifications, and tumor suppressor genes subject to homozygous deletions

4. __MSI status__
  * Indicates predicted microsatellite stability from the somatic mutation profile and supporting evidence (details of the underlying MSI statistical classifier can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/sigven/msi_classification_v3))
  * The MSI classifier was trained on TCGA exome samples.
      
5. __Tumor mutational burden (TMB)__
	* given a coding target region size specified by the user (ideally the __callable target size__), an estimate of the mutational burden is provided
	* The estimated TMB is shown in the context of TMB distributions from different primary sites in TCGA

6. __Mutational signatures__
  * Estimation of relative contribution of [known mutational signatures](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures) in tumor sample (using [MutationalPatterns](https://github.com/ToolsVanBox/MutationalPatterns) as the underlying framework)
  * Datatable with signatures found and proposed underlying etiologies
  
7. __RNA expression analysis__
  * Datatable with expression outliers - as compared to distribution in reference cohorts
  * Datatable with correlation between gene expression in query sample and other reference cohorts (TCGA, TreeHouse, DepMap)
  * Immune contexture profiling

8. __Documentation__
  * Annotation resources - databases with version and licensing information
	* Report contents - brief description of the main sections in the report
  * References - supporting scientific literature (key report elements)

### SNVs/InDels

#### 1. Variant call format - VCF

A VCF file containing annotated, somatic calls (single nucleotide variants and insertion/deletions) is generated with the following naming convention:

- `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.vcf.gz`
  - The __sample_id__ is provided as input by the user, and reflects a unique identifier of the tumor-normal sample pair to be analyzed. Following common standards, the annotated VCF file is compressed with [bgzip](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bgzip.html) and indexed with [tabix](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html). Below follows a description of all annotations/tags present in the VCF INFO column after processing with the PCGR annotation pipeline:

### Copy number aberrations

#### 1. Tab-separated values (TSV)

Copy number segments are intersected with the genomic coordinates of all transcripts from [GENCODE's basic gene annotation](https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/current.html). In addition, PCGR attaches cancer-relevant annotations for the affected transcripts. The naming convention of the compressed TSV files are as follows:

- `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.cna_segment.tsv.gz`
  - segment level information only
- `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.cna_gene_ann.tsv.gz`
  - This file is organized according to the _affected transcripts_ (i.e. one line/record per affected transcript, segments not overlapping with any transcripts will thus not be included in this files).

The format of the compressed `cna_gene_ann.tsv.gz` is the following:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1. `SAMPLE_ID` | Sample identifier |
| 2. `VAR_ID` | Variant identifier. Format: `<chromosome>:<segment_start>-<segment_end>:<major_cn>:<minor_cn>` |

### Gene expression data

If users provide bulk RNA-seq expression data as input, PCGR will attach basic gene annotations for the affected transcripts, and perform similarity analysis and outlier detection if configured by the user. The naming convention of the compressed TSV files are as follows:

* `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.expression.tsv.gz`
  - __NOTE__: This file is organized according to the _affected transcripts_ (i.e. one line/record per affected transcript). Contains basic annotations of the affected transcripts.
* `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.expression_similarity.tsv.gz`
  - __NOTE__: This file is organized according to the _samples_  of other gene expression cohorts (i.e. similarity level, one line/record per sample).
* `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.expression_outliers.tsv.gz`
  - __NOTE__: This file is organized according to how the expression levels of _genes/transcripts_ compare to the distribution of expression levels found in reference cohorts. This files contain various statistics in this respect (e.g. z-scores, IQR, Q1, Q2, Q3, percentile etc), enabling the detection of expression outliers.


### Excel workbook (XLSX)

The Excel workbook contains multiple sheets with data tables, mostly self-explainable, with annotated datasets pending on the analysis performed (assay/sample data, SNVs/InDels, CNAs, biomarker evidence, TMB, MSI, mutational signatures, immune contexture profiling etc). The naming convention of the Excel workbook is as follows: `<sample_id>.pcgr.<genome_assembly>.xlsx`. _Note_: To reduce the size of the SNVs/InDel sheets in the Excel workbook, we only include the clinically actionable variants as well as other exonic variants (including splice site variants, silent variants, and protein-altering variants).
