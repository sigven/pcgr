The PCGR software comes with a range of options to configure the analyses performed and to customize the output report.

## Key settings

Below, we will outline key settings that are important with respect to the sequencing assay that has been conducted.

### Whole-genome, whole-exome or targeted sequencing assay

By default, PCGR expects that the input VCF comes from whole-exome sequencing. This can be adjusted with the `assay` option, which takes three alternative values:

* `--assay <WGS|WES|TARGETED>`

 If the input VCF comes from a targeted sequencing assay/panel (i.e. `--assay TARGETED`), the target size of the assay/panel should be adjusted accordingly, which is critical for tumor mutational burden estimation. Assay target size, reflecting the _protein-coding portion of the assayed genomic region_ in megabases, can be configured through the following option:

 * `--effective_target_size_mb <value>`
 
Ideally, this should reflect the _callable_ target size of the assay, i.e. the size of the target regions for which coding variants is sufficiently covered (i.e. with a certain sequencing depth) by the sequencing assay. This can be estimated by the user based on the design of the sequencing assay, or by using tools such as [mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth).

### Tumor-control vs. tumor-only

By default, PCGR expects that the input VCF contains somatic variants identified from a tumor-control sequencing setup. This implies that the VCF contains information with respect to variant allelic depth/support both for the tumor sample and the corresponding control sample.

If the input VCF comes from a __tumor-only__ assay, turn on the `--tumor_only` option. In this mode, PCGR conducts a set of successive filtering steps on the raw input set of variants, aiming to exclude the majority of germline variants from the tumor-only input set. In addition to default filtering applied against variants found in the gnomAD database (population-specific minor allele frequency thresholds can be configured, see below), additional filtering procedures can be explicitly set, i.e.:

* `--exclude_dbsnp_nonsomatic`
* `--exclude_likely_het_germline`
* `--exclude_likely_hom_germline`
* `--exclude_clinvar_germline`
* `--exclude_nonexonic`

Users should note that these filters may occasionally remove true somatic variants, and should thus be used with caution.

If the user has provided a [panel-of-normals VCF file](input.html#panel-of-normals-vcf) as input(`--pon_vcf`), one may also opt to remove variants found in that variant collection using a dedicated option:

* `--exclude_pon`

<hr>

__IMPORTANT NOTE 1__: A number of the analyses available in PCGR are not particularly well-suited for tumor-only input, e.g. mutational signature analysis and MSI status prediction.
__IMPORTANT NOTE 2__: If you run PCGR on tumor-only WGS assays, we strongly recommend that you pre-filter your VCF against the exome, since we have frequently encountered that the large unfiltered variant set from such assays will cause a crash in PCGR. See also [this issue](https://github.com/sigven/pcgr/issues/178).

### Sample properties

A few selected properties of the tumor sample that should be determined prior to PCGR analysis can be provided, currently only used for display/reporting:

* `--tumor_ploidy <value>` - ploidy estimate
* `--tumor_purity <value>` - purity estimate

#### Tumor site

The primary tissue/site of the tumor sample that is analyzed can and should be be provided, through the following option:

* `--tumor_site <value>`

This option takes a value between 0 and 30, reflecting the main primary sites/tissues for human cancers. This
information is used e.g. to discriminate between on and off-label targeted therapies from the actionable biomarkers detected in the sample. Note that the default value is __0__ (implies __Any__ tissue/site), which essentially prohibits the presence of [tier 1 variants](variant_classification.html) occurring in the report. 

The following lists the possible encodings, and the corresponding primary tissues/sites:

```
0 = Any
1 = Adrenal Gland
2 = Ampulla of Vater
3 = Biliary Tract
4 = Bladder/Urinary Tract
5 = Bone
6 = Breast
7 = Cervix
8 = CNS/Brain
9 = Colon/Rectum
10 = Esophagus/Stomach
11 = Eye
12 = Head and Neck
13 = Kidney
14 = Liver
15 = Lung
16 = Lymphoid
17 = Myeloid
18 = Ovary/Fallopian Tube
19 = Pancreas
20 = Peripheral Nervous System
21 = Peritoneum
22 = Pleura
23 = Prostate
24 = Skin
25 = Soft Tissue
26 = Testis
27 = Thymus
28 = Thyroid
29 = Uterus
30 = Vulva/Vagina
(default: 0 - any tumor type)
```

If you want to check the nature of cancer subtypes attributed to each of the primary tissue/sites, take a look at the [table with phenotype terms and associated primary sites](primary_tumor_sites.html).

### Allelic support

Proper designation of INFO tags in the input VCF that denote variant depth/allelic fraction is critical to make the report as comprehensive as possible. See the [input section](input.html) on how to accomplish this.

Several options are used to inform PCGR about tags in the VCF INFO field that encodes this information:

- `--tumor_dp_tag <value>`
- `--tumor_af_tag <value>`
- `--control_dp_tag <value>`
- `--control_af_tag <value>`

If these tags are set correctly, one may set thresholds (sequencing depth and/or allelic fraction) on the variants to be included in the report, i.e. through:

- `--tumor_dp_min <value>`
- `--tumor_af_min <value>`
- `--control_dp_min <value>`
- `--control_af_max <value>`

### Tumor mutational burden (TMB)

If tags for allelic support is provided in the VCF and configured by the user, users can configure the TMB calculation by setting minimum requirements for sequencing coverage and allelic fraction, i.e.:

- `--tmb_dp_min <value>`
- `--tmb_af_min <value>`

### Large input sets (VCF)

For input VCF files with > 500,000 variants, note that these will be subject to filtering prior to the final step in PCGR (step 4: reporting). For such scenarios, raw input sets will be filtered according to consequence type, in the sense that intergenic/intronic/upstream/downstream gene variants will be excluded prior to reporting. This is a necessary step to avoid memory issues etc. during processing with the PCGR R package. 

If you have a large input VCF, and have sufficient memory capacity on your compute platform, we also recommend to increase the [VEP buffer size](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_options.html#cacheopt) (option `--vep_buffer_size`), as this will speed up the VEP processing significantly.

### Configuration of output files

If you only want the Excel/TSV output (with all variant classifications and auxiliary analyses (e.g. MSI classifications, TMB estimates, mutational signatures predictions) of PCGR, you may turn off the HTML output by using the `--no_html` option. This will speed up the analysis, and could be a useful option if you foresee that the sample input datasets are too large for the HTML report generation to work properly.

If you only want the annotated VCF (also converted to TSV), use the option `--no_reporting`. This will skip the final steps of the PCGR workflow, and only generate the annotated VCF and TSV files.

## Example run

The _examples_ folder contains input VCF files from two tumor samples sequenced within TCGA. A molecular interpretation report for a colorectal tumor sample can be generated by running the following command in your terminal window (this assumes you have installed PCGR through Conda, and that you have downloaded the necessary reference data files, VEP cache, see [Installation](installation.html)):


```bash
$ (base) conda activate pcgr
$ (pcgr)
pcgr \
    --refdata_dir /Users/you/dir2/data \
    --vep_dir /Users/you/dir3/vep/.vep \
    --output_dir /Users/you/dir4/pcgr_outputs \
    --sample_id T001-COAD \
    --genome_assembly grch37 \
    --input_vcf /Users/you/pcgr/examples/T001-COAD.grch37.vcf.gz \
    --tumor_dp_tag TDP \
    --tumor_af_tag TVAF \
    --tumor_site 9 \
    --input_cna /Users/you/pcgr/examples/T001-COAD.cna.tsv \
    --sex MALE \
    --tumor_purity 0.9 \
    --tumor_ploidy 2.0 \
    --assay WES \
    --vcf2maf \
    --estimate_signatures \
    --estimate_msi \
    --estimate_tmb \
    --force_overwrite
```

This command will run the Conda-based PCGR workflow and produce the following files in the _/Users/you/dir4/pcgr_outputs_ folder:

| N | File | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | __\<sample_id\>.pcgr.grch37.html__ | An interactive HTML report for clinical interpretation (quarto-based) |
| 2 | __\<sample_id\>.pcgr.grch37.xlsx__ | An excel workbook with multiple sheets of annotations (Assay & sample info/SNVs & InDels/CNAs/biomarkers/TMB/MSI), suitable for aggregation analysis across multiple samples |
